# Software
All software is from open source directories or coded by myself. Main inspirations were from Maker Ttur on YT (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtwFpFIS1_0&ab_channel=MakerTutor) and HighVoltages.co (https://highvoltages.co/tutorial/arduino-tutorial/combinational-lock-using-push-button-and-arduino/)
